A mosaic plot (also known as a Marimekko diagram) is a graphical method for visualizing data from two or more qualitative variables.

A mosaic plot is basically an area-proportional visualization of (typically, observed)
frequencies, composed of tiles (corresponding to the cells) created by recursive vertical and horizontal splits of a rectangle. Thus, the area of each tile is proportional to the corresponding cell entry given the dimensions of previous splits.
