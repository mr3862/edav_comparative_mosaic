Community Contribution - comparative study of vcd::mosaic and geom_mosaic

A mosaic plot (also known as a Marimekko diagram) is a graphical method for visualizing data from two or more qualitative variables.

A mosaic plot is basically an area-proportional visualization of (typically, observed)
frequencies, composed of tiles (corresponding to the cells) created by recursive vertical and horizontal splits of a rectangle. Thus, the area of each tile is proportional to the corresponding cell entry given the dimensions of previous splits.

In the study, we try to explain how to use these two functions to produce mosaice plot. We have elborate different parameters that are used in the function in detail. As a matter of fact, a new user will able to understand very easily what he needs to provide. On the other hand, the existing documentation of those functions is not user-friendly for the new users. It has limited number of example in different scenario.

Finally, we showed which functins is better in which scenario. vcd::mosaic is better in some cases whereas geom_mosaic is better other cases based one the avaialbe data and the objective.
